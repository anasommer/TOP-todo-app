// Create a UI for the project
// Create a Todo list app using js modules
// Show the list of Todos if there are any stored in the localStorage
// Show the projects if there are any as tabs like in restaurant app
// The user should be able to navigate between the different todos projects and see only those that are related to the selected project (filter the other ones)
// Add a button for adding the New Task
// The button will open a modal
// The modal should include a form for adding a task
// The form should include fields: Title, Description, dueDate, Priority & the Project name where the task should be placed into (if there is aldready created some projects)
// Add a form submit
// When form is submitted, the task will be added to the localStorage
// Then the task will appear in the list of todos
// The task can be checked as Done, can be Edited or Removed (add buttons or icons to implement this functionality)
